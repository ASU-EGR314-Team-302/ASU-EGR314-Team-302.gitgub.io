## Communication Procedures:

The team will mainly communicate over the phone and through a text chain with every member in it, thus communicating can be fast and efficient when we are not meeting in person. Discord and or email will be the second form of communication if someone cannot be reached over text as everyone in the group has both. Phone calls will be seen as a last resort if someone is needed to be contacted urgently. If none of those channels work then communication will be made in class.

**Note:** The most beneficial time for outside meetings for the team is on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 3PM to 6PM. 

## Roles & Responsibilities

### *Table 2: Project Roles and Duties*

| Role | Member | Duties |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Meeting Leader | Justin Hanson | Schedules team meetings, creates and distributes the agenda for each meeting, and runs each meeting  in order to communicate effectively. |
| Minutes | Evan Lininger | Takes minutes of each team meeting and records action items and to whom they are assigned. |
| Assignment Leader | Jason Klinkbeil | Coordinates the team's work on a given assignment to Canvas before the due date. |
| Project Monitor | Alijah Williams | Tracks the team's progress relative to the project schedule (Gantt chart) and keeps team members apprised of deadlines and project status. |



## Team Coordination & Accountability

The assignment leader will keep track of teamwork and will ensure that each team member is happy with the work done. Then the assignment leader will ensure that the assignment is submitted on time. Other team members will also work to ensure that the team submit tasks properly.

As previously mentioned in the Communication Procedures, the primary form of communication is via text and in-person communication during meetings, as discussed in the Meeting Schedule, and in class. Additionally, as previously mentioned in Roles and Responsibilities Accountability Procedure, each team member is expected to contribute to group discussions, the building of the project, and the group assignments. Feedback will be reviewed by everyone soon after it is given so that it can be incorporated into the subsystem designs and into the overall project.

It is expected that each member’s roles are subject to change/expand over the course of the project. However, if a member is unwilling to participate and be an active member, the procedure outlined in Conflict Recognition & Resolution will be followed. If contributions are missed the group member that did not fulfill their obligation will have their shortcomings discussed amongst the entire group so as to assess what to do as outlined in Conflict Recognition & Resolution. If someone is underperforming and needs help, help will be offered by the group members when they have the time to spare, however the group member should also ask the teaching staff for help so that they may improve. If the student does not improve the teaching staff will be contacted as stated in the Conflict Recognition & Resolution part of the charter and they will most likely be pink slipped if all avenues fail.

## Conflict Recognition & Resolution

Conflicts will be resolved through a team based system and through active communication between other group members as to what might need to be done if someone isn’t doing their part in completing the project. These discussions will happen in the team meetings if needed and the party who is in question will be allowed to explain themselves as to the reasons for their shortcomings. Tardiness will be handled in a similar way unless a group member is missing class due to a family emergency and or if they are sick, however, if that is the case some form of communication will be useful in order to clear that up. If group members are unable to resolve conflict as a group, we will contact the teaching staff accordingly.
