(Explicit). <br> 2. It is accurate at displaying the readings it receives. (Explicit). <br> 3. It works both indoors and outdoors as it says it does. (Explicit). |
| “This unit has a very clear, easy to read digital screen. I like the amount of information that is available. It has clear readings for Inside and Outside Temperature along with Humidity readings for inside and out as well.” | 1. The readings are clear and easy to read. (Explicit). <br> 2. Displays the correct readings indoor and outdoors. (Explicit). <br>  3. Is easy for those who may be visually impaired or elderly  due to it being so bright and clear to see. (Latent). |
| “This is the best indoor/outdoor thermometer I’ve had. It was easy to install and easy to read. I just touch the top of it and it lights up to show, in large print, the indoor and outdoor temperature, current conditions like clouds, rain, sun and the direction it’s going.” | 1. The device was easy to install into the home. (Explicit).<br>2. The device is easy to operate for the user. (Explicit).<br>3. The device is able to display the weather conditions. (Explicit). |

| “Worked fine during our dry weather. As soon as the humidity/rain increased, we had problems. I went to replace the outdoor batteries (despite only having the unit 2 1/2 months) and noticed that there was rust on the internal springs and connectors. I cleaned everything off, let it dry out inside for 2 days, put in new batteries--and it worked again--for 3 weeks. Went throught the same process--and now 3 weeks later--the outdoor temperature isn't working again. The unit is located under the eaves of our porch, well-removed from any direct moisture. However, we live in a humid coastal area and obviously this is not designed to work in that type of weather. I have now installed the outdoor unit in a ziploc bag--it may throw off the temp readings a little, but at least maybe I'll get something close to what the outdoor temperature is.” | 1. Needs to be able to work in the humidity/ Rain. (Explicit).<br>2. The product needs to be waterproof or able to handle the outdoors with minimal wear. (Explicit).<br>3. The product should have accurate readings of the temperature outdoors. (Explicit). |
| “I've had two of these indoor-outdoor thermometers. They worked well at first, but both sensors completely stopped working after the first rain. After allowing them to dry out, one didn't work at all, and the other started giving bogus readings --- right now it says it's -32 degrees in my office! Clearly the sensor is NOT weatherproof, which is crazy for a device of this type. Skip this one unless you live in the Atacama Desert!” | 1. The device needs to be able to last a while and in the elements without malfunctioning. (Explicit).<br>2. The device needs to be able to withstand weather conditions. (Explicit).<br>3. The device needs to be easily repairable so it can be fixed after withstanding damage to its parts. (Latent). |
| “I installed this less than a year ago so I could monitor the temperature in my Florida Winter home while absent in the hot Summer months. It worked for a while, then started showing the reading LL.L. When I returned to FL & tried to fix it, there apparently is no way, and the maker provided NO assistance. The Web says this reading is the result of a temperature too low ... in South Florida???? I tried everything without success & concluded the outdoor sensor was faulty, since the batteries worked fine. I had to go to Lowe's to get another, since I couldn't trust the Amazon sellers of this product. DO NOT BUY if you want a working product.” | 1. The device needs to have sustained longevity even in the elements. (Explicit).<br>2. The drive needs a way for it to be repairable or replaced. (Explicit).<br>3. The product needs to work and be reliable. (Explicit). |

| As you can see, the temperature reading is very small, and you can't really read it unless you're looking straight at it, but it worked well enough. I was able to calculate during the cold wave the duration I'd have to leave my heater on in order to keep the temperature at 65F. I live in Louisiana so the cold wave didn't last long, but this really saved me a lot of anxiety.” | 1. Product circuitry must operate in cold temperatures. (Explicit) <br> 2. Reduced the stress of the user by assisting them with reading the temperature. (Latent). <br> 3. The product could stand to be bigger and easier to read. (Latent). |
| “Compared both thermometers to our larger and pricier thermostats; fairly accurate. Comes with an extra set of batteries for both, along with the adhesive stickers (3M brand so fairly durable). Batteries are easy to replace, though you may have to buy more stickers for the back since you have to take it off to get to the battery compartment. They can stand on their own as well. Takes several minutes for the temperature to adjust.” | 1. The thermometer is accurate at reading and displaying the temperature. (Explicit). <br> 2. The batteries are replaceable for the users so the device can have continued use . (Explicit). <br>  3. The temperature needs to be able to be read quickly. (Latent). |
| “This was an easy and inexpensive way to replace an old hygrometer. It didn’t take up much room and seems to be accurate.” | 1. The device was inexpensive to buy for the user. (Explicit). <br> 2. It is compact and accurate at reading the temperature. (Explicit). <br>3. The device is most likely very cheap to manufacture and develop. (Latent). |
