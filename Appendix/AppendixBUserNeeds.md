| “Worked fine during our dry weather. As soon as the humidity/rain increased, we had problems. I went to replace the outdoor batteries (despite only having the unit 2 1/2 months) and noticed that there was rust on the internal springs and connectors. I cleaned everything off, let it dry out inside for 2 days, put in new batteries--and it worked again--for 3 weeks. Went throught the same process--and now 3 weeks later--the outdoor temperature isn't working again. The unit is located under the eaves of our porch, well-removed from any direct moisture. However, we live in a humid coastal area and obviously this is not designed to work in that type of weather. I have now installed the outdoor unit in a ziploc bag--it may throw off the temp readings a little, but at least maybe I'll get something close to what the outdoor temperature is.” | 1. Needs to be able to work in the humidity/ Rain. (Explicit).<br>2. The product needs to be waterproof or able to handle the outdoors with minimal wear. (Explicit).<br>3. The product should have accurate readings of the temperature outdoors. (Explicit). |
| “I've had two of these indoor-outdoor thermometers. They worked well at first, but both sensors completely stopped working after the first rain. After allowing them to dry out, one didn't work at all, and the other started giving bogus readings --- right now it says it's -32 degrees in my office! Clearly the sensor is NOT weatherproof, which is crazy for a device of this type. Skip this one unless you live in the Atacama Desert!” | 1. The device needs to be able to last a while and in the elements without malfunctioning. (Explicit).<br>2. The device needs to be able to withstand weather conditions. (Explicit).<br>3. The device needs to be easily repairable so it can be fixed after withstanding damage to its parts. (Latent). |
| “I installed this less than a year ago so I could monitor the temperature in my Florida Winter home while absent in the hot Summer months. It worked for a while, then started showing the reading LL.L. When I returned to FL & tried to fix it, there apparently is no way, and the maker provided NO assistance. The Web says this reading is the result of a temperature too low ... in South Florida???? I tried everything without success & concluded the outdoor sensor was faulty, since the batteries worked fine. I had to go to Lowe's to get another, since I couldn't trust the Amazon sellers of this product. DO NOT BUY if you want a working product.” | 1. The device needs to have sustained longevity even in the elements. (Explicit).<br>2. The drive needs a way for it to be repairable or replaced. (Explicit).<br>3. The product needs to work and be reliable. (Explicit). |

| As you can see, the temperature reading is very small, and you can't really read it unless you're looking straight at it, but it worked well enough. I was able to calculate during the cold wave the duration I'd have to leave my heater on in order to keep the temperature at 65F. I live in Louisiana so the cold wave didn't last long, but this really saved me a lot of anxiety.” | 1. Product circuitry must operate in cold temperatures. (Explicit) <br> 2. Reduced the stress of the user by assisting them with reading the temperature. (Latent). <br> 3. The product could stand to be bigger and easier to read. (Latent). |
| “Compared both thermometers to our larger and pricier thermostats; fairly accurate. Comes with an extra set of batteries for both, along with the adhesive stickers (3M brand so fairly durable). Batteries are easy to replace, though you may have to buy more stickers for the back since you have to take it off to get to the battery compartment. They can stand on their own as well. Takes several minutes for the temperature to adjust.” | 1. The thermometer is accurate at reading and displaying the temperature. (Explicit). <br> 2. The batteries are replaceable for the users so the device can have continued use . (Explicit). <br>  3. The temperature needs to be able to be read quickly. (Latent). |
| “This was an easy and inexpensive way to replace an old hygrometer. It didn’t take up much room and seems to be accurate.” | 1. The device was inexpensive to buy for the user. (Explicit). <br> 2. It is compact and accurate at reading the temperature. (Explicit). <br>3. The device is most likely very cheap to manufacture and develop. (Latent). |

| “I bought a two pack and set them both side by side. Temps don't match and are about 8 degrees warmer than really is. Humidity sensors have a 4% difference. What's the point if they aren't close to accurate? | 1. The device needs to be able to read the temperature accurately. (Explicit). <br> 2. The device should be able to measure the humidity accurately. (Explicit). <br> 3. The device came in a two pack allowing the user to have multiple of the same device. (Latent). |
| “One was broken, Saler did not help! Product feels cheaply done! Work to fix the problem on my own and was not successful. Gave up! Will not buy again!”  | 1. The devices did not all work once the user got a hold of it. (Explicit). <br> 2. The product was most likely made using cheap materials. (Latent). <br>  3. The device was not repairable by the user once it was broken. (Explicit). |
| “I wonder how long they were on before I got them? They did send extra batteries but it would've been nice if they worked. Wondering if this is a joke and I'll be getting ones that actually work tomorrow?” | 1. The devices did not work when the user finally got it. (Explicit). <br> 2.  <br> 3. The device while cheap did not seem to be accurate or working for most users and often had discrepancies in their temperature measurements. (Latent). |

| “Works well. I can check the specific gravity and temperature from anywhere in my house. So much easier to use than the "manual" hydrometers I have used and no waste of wort to take samples.” | 1. Monitor over WiFi (Explicit) <br> 2. More convenient than manual measuring tools (latent) <br> 3. Accurate Measurements (Explicit) |
| “No more mess and no more increased risk of contamination as the Digital Hydrometer just floats in the primary sending out its bluetooth signal. The app could certainly be so much better with data logging, graphing, etc., but it works just fine, giving you the current reading of specific gravity and temperature. I just keep a log to trend the fermentaion progress in a basic excel file. The accuracy seems spot on compared with a couple of confirmation samples I tested.” | 1. Decreased contamination (because of WiFi monitoring) (Explicit) <br> 2. Would benefit from logging past data (Explicit) <br>  3. Electricals could be protected from outside factors (waterproof etc.) (Latent) |
| “Works great. Important info garnered without having to sample or otherwise be invasive to the fermenting wort.” | 1. Noninvasive sampling (Latent) <br> 2. Clearly Displays important information (Explicit) <br> 3. Simple to use |

| “I have used it once. It EVENTUALLY connects to Bluetooth on my phone but boy it takes a long time. Sometimes not at all. I don’t know. None of my other Bluetooth devices take so long. I guess it works but I am thinking they need to work on the blue tooth connectivity. I am using it inside of a steel conical but heck I am standing right next to it when I try to connect.” | 1. Easy to connect to wirelessly (Explicit) <br> 2. Should have a strong connection even through objects (Latent) <br> 3. Should be able to hold connection over long distances (Latent) |
| “Received and would not work. After a few I relied to emails, we tried a new battery. And it came to life. In the meantime, NB sent a replacement. We are returning that one and sticking with our original unit with the new battery. Still monitoring how well it works and will decide if we get another.” | 1. Should be reliable (Explicit) <br> 2. Long battery life (Latent) <br>  3. Easy to fix (Latent) |
| “The instructions on this device are poor. While I cannot speak on how reliable the data is meant to be read, majority of users will say this is more for seeing trends in your gravity.I didn't calibrate prior to using (because the instructions don't mention doing so).. So, now I have a poor gravity reading that has changed a few points during the entire fermentation, with an "uncalibrated" reading above that which is not being recorded...Hopefully using the calibrate feature will allow the proper readings to be uploaded to my excel next time? No clue” | 1. Easy to learn to use (Explicit) <br> 2. Could log long-term use data (Latent) <br> 3. Should record accurate and consistent measurements (Explicit) |

| “I LOVE this fan. It has a sleek modern design, and the white version looks gorgeous against white walls. <br> Tons of easy-to-use settings: auto-off screen display within around 30 seconds which is great for nighttime; ability to silence the button-beeps; a natural wind mode that mimics the variability of true wind outdoors. <br> <br> It doesn’t vibrate or make any unnecessary noise, and it’s perfect. Sign up for the warranty on Dreo’s website and they will replace your fan if needed!” | 1. The sleek modern design appealed heavily to the user as it looked good in their home. (Explicit). <br> 2. The device was easy to use and had a veritable amount of modes and settings for the user to utilize. (Explicit). <br> 3. The fan is silent and does not make a whole lot of unnecessary noise. (Explicit). |
| “Remote works well, there are 4 speed settings, the first three are very quiet for the amount of air flow being pushed, the 4th one is kind of a "boost" setting and is significantly louder for max airflow, but still not nearly as loud as a traditional fan, especially for the amount of air this thing pushes and the distance to which it pushes it. It is not silent but it is quiet and powerful. I do not recommend for bedrooms however. We got this for sleeping purposes and because of the low vertical profile, 80% of the air just gets pushed into the side of the bed and very little to the sleepers as it is only a small bit taller than an average height bed. We opted for a traditional fan for sleeping and this one keeps us cool on the couch.” | 1. The device works well via a remote control device and can change its speed with it. (Explicit). <br> 2. The fan has 4 different speeds which allows for more variety for the user to find their ideal speed. (Explicit). <br>  3. The fan is tall allowing for more air to flow across the room and also for it to cool more of the room. (Latent). |
| “My wife loves sleeping with a fan every night. Her previous one sounded like a small plane taking off and was so old. So, for Christmas I purchased this one for her. She loves the remote feature since she can adjust the fan speed at night without having to get up and get out of bed. I love that I can actually hear sounds throughout the rest of the house now. While level 4 can be a bit noisy, levels 1 and 2 are so quiet, you wouldn't even know the fan was on. <br> <br> I also purchased another product from this company at the same time. It recently had an issue, which I addressed with customer service. Their customer service rep got back to me in less than 30 minutes, was super kind and helpful, and they offered to replace thebpart for free. For this reason alone, I will gladly support Dreo and their line of products.”| 1. The fan is quiet compared to other fans allowing for the users to use it more often especially at night. (Explicit). <br> 2. The fan speed is adjustable and can be controlled by the user via a remote. (Explicit). <br> 3. The fan has to be able to adjust the temperature to ideal settings for the user, thus adjustable fan speed is necessary. (Latent). |

| “I am upset. Everything about this item- from the delivery to trying to contact the seller has been poor. The item was delivered late, which I understand is most likely out of sellers control. However, when I did receive it, I set it up and realized the oscillation feature does not work. I try to trouble shoot the with sellers trouble shoot options and it does not fix anything. But you cannot contact the seller, only option is the troubleshoot page which did not resolve anything. I waited for this due to a delayed delivery and it doesn’t even fully function and I cannot reach out to the company. I am so frustrated!!!!! Not worth the money because the headache with this thing is not worth it!!!” | 1. The oscillation feature needs to work in order to be able to cool the entire surrounding and not just one area. (Explicit). <br> 2. The user had trouble contacting the maker about potential solutions to the problems they were having with the product. (Explicit). <br> 3. The device did not fully function once the user received the device from the vendor. (Explicit). |
| “I bought this fan a little over a year ago. I barely ever used it. The motor probably had 5 hours of running time. After about 7 months of not using it in a spare room, I turned it on and within one minute it completed quit. I assume it’s a fuse but either way I won’t buy another one bc replacing the fuse or motor requires soldering and replacing the part which is more time consuming and expensive than it is to buy something else. So for about $60 I got about 6 hours of use out it and it was in perfect condition. Maybe I received a lemon but I do not recommend.” | 1. The fans battery life did not seem to last very long even with minimal use. (Explicit). <br> 2. The repairs for the device are far more expensive and time consuming then the user would like or need to keep using it. (Explicit). <br>  3. The device was expensive compared to how much use the user was able to get from it. (Explicit). |
| “I regret buying this fan. With all the reviews and the high rating I thought the fan would be decent. For the first week it was ok, but then of course we get rid of the box and it starts making this horrible buzzing noise while it's on. And the fan noise doesn't drown it out, if you turn the fan speed higher it just gets worse. The fan really is also only any good if you're sitting in front of it, it doesn't cool down the room at all like our other tower fan. I do like the soft buttons on the remote though...but that isn't why I got the fan. I don't recommend anyone getting this unless it's to put in a garage or somewhere where it'll be noisy when you have it on.” | 1. The fan was not completely quiet and often made terrible noises unlike it says in its product description. (Explicit). <br> 2. The fan did not rotate and often only cooled a small area compared to other fans that are similar. (Explicit). <br> 3. The remote was easy to use for the user and provided an easy way to adjust the speed whilst also not being hard to use. (Explicit). |
