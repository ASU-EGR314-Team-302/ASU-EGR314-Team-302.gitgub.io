# Appendix D: Product Requirements

### Use Cases:
---
### User Story #1: John

John is a 33 year old middle school science teacher located in Phoenix Arizona. His class is currently studying climate and weather patterns in the Sonoran Desert. Typically, they use an old fashioned thermometer and record various temperatures throughout the day. The only thing is these temperatures are only monitored during school hours as John lives 45 minutes from the local school. Creating a device that can record the outdoor temperatures while surviving the harsh desert heat would be an ideal solution to help John give more accurate data to his students and take their science class to the next level. Proposed ideas for the Uniform Climate Controller aims to help John and anyone else who is looking for accurate weather tracking and recording.

### User Story #2: William

William is a 6’7” 26-year-old professional sprinter located in Miami Florida. When he’s not out running, he is inside trying to escape the heat and humidity of Florida summers. His current air conditioning setup is lacking in some regards in terms of power, and usage. William wants a way to both cool down and prevent his home from getting humid when exposed to the elements. His current unit doesn’t accurately track the humidity in the environment or keep a log of the levels of humidity and temperature. He is excited about the new Uniform Climate Controller (UCC). With his new UCC, he can properly control the air in his house and schedule/forecast the future conditions of the house to ensure that it is in a proper climate at the proper time. William can control the climate in his house from anywhere and ensure that he has a comfortable house to come home to after his runs, safe from the Florida weather. 

Now William will only buy his climate control devices from UCC, for all of his comfort needs.

### __Open Questions:__
---
* Can we move towards a recyclable and repairable product, for example, with ZIF connectors and glue-free assembly?
* Can we improve on failing or self-igniting batteries?
* Can we improve WiFi connectivity?
