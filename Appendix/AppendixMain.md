### *Table 1: Team Member Communication Modes*

| Name | First Choice Communication | Second Choice Communicaiton | Third Choice Communication |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | 
| Alijah Williams | Phone: 480-290-4686 | Email: ajwill65@asu.edu | Discord: Fragget |
| Jason Klinkbeil | Phone: 585-479-5206 | Discord: JKlinks#5577 | Email: jklinkbeil@asu.edu |

| Evan Lininger | Phone: 480-251-1882 | Email: elininge@asu.edu | Discord: Mr_No_Lungs#5665 |

<br>

### Communication Procedures:
---
The team will mainly communicate over the phone and through a text chain with every member in it, thus communicating can be fast and efficient when we are not meeting in person. Discord and or email will be the second form of communication if someone cannot be reached over text as everyone in the group has both. Phone calls will be seen as a last resort if someone is needed to be contacted urgently. If none of those channels work then communication will be made in class. 

<br>


### *Figure 1: Meeting Schedule*

![Meeting Schedule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ASU-EGR314-Team-302/ASU-EGR314-Team-302.gitgub.io/main/docs/assets/images/meetingschedule.png)

**Note:** *The most beneficial time for outside meetings for the team is on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 3PM to 6PM.* 

<br>


### Roles & Responsibilities
---
### *Table 2: Project Roles and Duties*

| Role | Member | Duties |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Meeting Leader | Justin Hanson | Schedules team meetings, creates and distributes the agenda for each meeting, and runs each meeting  in order to communicate effectively. |
| Minutes | Evan Lininger | Takes minutes of each team meeting and records action items and to whom they are assigned. |
| Assignment Leader | Jason Klinkbeil | Coordinates the team's work on a given assignment to Canvas before the due date. |
| Project Monitor | Alijah Williams | Tracks the team's progress relative to the project schedule (Gantt chart) and keeps team members apprised of deadlines and project status. |

<br>

### Team Coordination & Accountability
---
The assignment leader will keep track of teamwork and will ensure that each team member is happy with the work done. Then the assignment leader will ensure that the assignment is submitted on time. Other team members will also work to ensure that the team submit tasks properly.

As previously mentioned in the Communication Procedures, the primary form of communication is via text and in-person communication during meetings, as discussed in the Meeting Schedule, and in class. Additionally, as previously mentioned in Roles and Responsibilities Accountability Procedure, each team member is expected to contribute to group discussions, the building of the project, and the group assignments. Feedback will be reviewed by everyone soon after it is given so that it can be incorporated into the subsystem designs and into the overall project.

It is expected that each member’s roles are subject to change/expand over the course of the project. However, if a member is unwilling to participate and be an active member, the procedure outlined in Conflict Recognition & Resolution will be followed. If contributions are missed the group member that did not fulfill their obligation will have their shortcomings discussed amongst the entire group so as to assess what to do as outlined in Conflict Recognition & Resolution. If someone is underperforming and needs help, help will be offered by the group members when they have the time to spare, however the group member should also ask the teaching staff for help so that they may improve. If the student does not improve the teaching staff will be contacted as stated in the Conflict Recognition & Resolution part of the charter and they will most likely be pink slipped if all avenues fail.

<br>

### Conflict Recognition & Resolution
---
Conflicts will be resolved through a team based system and through active communication between other group members as to what might need to be done if someone isn’t doing their part in completing the project. These discussions will happen in the team meetings if needed and the party who is in question will be allowed to explain themselves as to the reasons for their shortcomings. Tardiness will be handled in a similar way unless a group member is missing class due to a family emergency and or if they are sick, however, if that is the case some form of communication will be useful in order to clear that up. If group members are unable to resolve conflict as a group, we will contact the teaching staff accordingly.

| “Worked fine during our dry weather. As soon as the humidity/rain increased, we had problems. I went to replace the outdoor batteries (despite only having the unit 2 1/2 months) and noticed that there was rust on the internal springs and connectors. I cleaned everything off, let it dry out inside for 2 days, put in new batteries--and it worked again--for 3 weeks. Went throught the same process--and now 3 weeks later--the outdoor temperature isn't working again. The unit is located under the eaves of our porch, well-removed from any direct moisture. However, we live in a humid coastal area and obviously this is not designed to work in that type of weather. I have now installed the outdoor unit in a ziploc bag--it may throw off the temp readings a little, but at least maybe I'll get something close to what the outdoor temperature is.” | 1. Needs to be able to work in the humidity/ Rain. (Explicit).<br>2. The product needs to be waterproof or able to handle the outdoors with minimal wear. (Explicit).<br>3. The product should have accurate readings of the temperature outdoors. (Explicit). |
| “I've had two of these indoor-outdoor thermometers. They worked well at first, but both sensors completely stopped working after the first rain. After allowing them to dry out, one didn't work at all, and the other started giving bogus readings --- right now it says it's -32 degrees in my office! Clearly the sensor is NOT weatherproof, which is crazy for a device of this type. Skip this one unless you live in the Atacama Desert!” | 1. The device needs to be able to last a while and in the elements without malfunctioning. (Explicit).<br>2. The device needs to be able to withstand weather conditions. (Explicit).<br>3. The device needs to be easily repairable so it can be fixed after withstanding damage to its parts. (Latent). |
| “I installed this less than a year ago so I could monitor the temperature in my Florida Winter home while absent in the hot Summer months. It worked for a while, then started showing the reading LL.L. When I returned to FL & tried to fix it, there apparently is no way, and the maker provided NO assistance. The Web says this reading is the result of a temperature too low ... in South Florida???? I tried everything without success & concluded the outdoor sensor was faulty, since the batteries worked fine. I had to go to Lowe's to get another, since I couldn't trust the Amazon sellers of this product. DO NOT BUY if you want a working product.” | 1. The device needs to have sustained longevity even in the elements. (Explicit).<br>2. The drive needs a way for it to be repairable or replaced. (Explicit).<br>3. The product needs to work and be reliable. (Explicit). |

| As you can see, the temperature reading is very small, and you can't really read it unless you're looking straight at it, but it worked well enough. I was able to calculate during the cold wave the duration I'd have to leave my heater on in order to keep the temperature at 65F. I live in Louisiana so the cold wave didn't last long, but this really saved me a lot of anxiety.” | 1. Product circuitry must operate in cold temperatures. (Explicit) <br> 2. Reduced the stress of the user by assisting them with reading the temperature. (Latent). <br> 3. The product could stand to be bigger and easier to read. (Latent). |
| “Compared both thermometers to our larger and pricier thermostats; fairly accurate. Comes with an extra set of batteries for both, along with the adhesive stickers (3M brand so fairly durable). Batteries are easy to replace, though you may have to buy more stickers for the back since you have to take it off to get to the battery compartment. They can stand on their own as well. Takes several minutes for the temperature to adjust.” | 1. The thermometer is accurate at reading and displaying the temperature. (Explicit). <br> 2. The batteries are replaceable for the users so the device can have continued use . (Explicit). <br>  3. The temperature needs to be able to be read quickly. (Latent). |
| “This was an easy and inexpensive way to replace an old hygrometer. It didn’t take up much room and seems to be accurate.” | 1. The device was inexpensive to buy for the user. (Explicit). <br> 2. It is compact and accurate at reading the temperature. (Explicit). <br>3. The device is most likely very cheap to manufacture and develop. (Latent). |

| “Works well. I can check the specific gravity and temperature from anywhere in my house. So much easier to use than the "manual" hydrometers I have used and no waste of wort to take samples.” | 1. Monitor over WiFi (Explicit) <br> 2. More convenient than manual measuring tools (latent) <br> 3. Accurate Measurements (Explicit) |
| “No more mess and no more increased risk of contamination as the Digital Hydrometer just floats in the primary sending out its bluetooth signal. The app could certainly be so much better with data logging, graphing, etc., but it works just fine, giving you the current reading of specific gravity and temperature. I just keep a log to trend the fermentaion progress in a basic excel file. The accuracy seems spot on compared with a couple of confirmation samples I tested.” | 1. Decreased contamination (because of WiFi monitoring) (Explicit) <br> 2. Would benefit from logging past data (Explicit) <br>  3. Electricals could be protected from outside factors (waterproof etc.) (Latent) |
| “Works great. Important info garnered without having to sample or otherwise be invasive to the fermenting wort.” | 1. Noninvasive sampling (Latent) <br> 2. Clearly Displays important information (Explicit) <br> 3. Simple to use |

| “I LOVE this fan. It has a sleek modern design, and the white version looks gorgeous against white walls. <br> Tons of easy-to-use settings: auto-off screen display within around 30 seconds which is great for nighttime; ability to silence the button-beeps; a natural wind mode that mimics the variability of true wind outdoors. <br> <br> It doesn’t vibrate or make any unnecessary noise, and it’s perfect. Sign up for the warranty on Dreo’s website and they will replace your fan if needed!” | 1. The sleek modern design appealed heavily to the user as it looked good in their home. (Explicit). <br> 2. The device was easy to use and had a veritable amount of modes and settings for the user to utilize. (Explicit). <br> 3. The fan is silent and does not make a whole lot of unnecessary noise. (Explicit). |
| “Remote works well, there are 4 speed settings, the first three are very quiet for the amount of air flow being pushed, the 4th one is kind of a "boost" setting and is significantly louder for max airflow, but still not nearly as loud as a traditional fan, especially for the amount of air this thing pushes and the distance to which it pushes it. It is not silent but it is quiet and powerful. I do not recommend for bedrooms however. We got this for sleeping purposes and because of the low vertical profile, 80% of the air just gets pushed into the side of the bed and very little to the sleepers as it is only a small bit taller than an average height bed. We opted for a traditional fan for sleeping and this one keeps us cool on the couch.” | 1. The device works well via a remote control device and can change its speed with it. (Explicit). <br> 2. The fan has 4 different speeds which allows for more variety for the user to find their ideal speed. (Explicit). <br>  3. The fan is tall allowing for more air to flow across the room and also for it to cool more of the room. (Latent). |
| “My wife loves sleeping with a fan every night. Her previous one sounded like a small plane taking off and was so old. So, for Christmas I purchased this one for her. She loves the remote feature since she can adjust the fan speed at night without having to get up and get out of bed. I love that I can actually hear sounds throughout the rest of the house now. While level 4 can be a bit noisy, levels 1 and 2 are so quiet, you wouldn't even know the fan was on. <br> <br> I also purchased another product from this company at the same time. It recently had an issue, which I addressed with customer service. Their customer service rep got back to me in less than 30 minutes, was super kind and helpful, and they offered to replace thebpart for free. For this reason alone, I will gladly support Dreo and their line of products.”| 1. The fan is quiet compared to other fans allowing for the users to use it more often especially at night. (Explicit). <br> 2. The fan speed is adjustable and can be controlled by the user via a remote. (Explicit). <br> 3. The fan has to be able to adjust the temperature to ideal settings for the user, thus adjustable fan speed is necessary. (Latent). |

| “I am upset. Everything about this item- from the delivery to trying to contact the seller has been poor. The item was delivered late, which I understand is most likely out of sellers control. However, when I did receive it, I set it up and realized the oscillation feature does not work. I try to trouble shoot the with sellers trouble shoot options and it does not fix anything. But you cannot contact the seller, only option is the troubleshoot page which did not resolve anything. I waited for this due to a delayed delivery and it doesn’t even fully function and I cannot reach out to the company. I am so frustrated!!!!! Not worth the money because the headache with this thing is not worth it!!!” | 1. The oscillation feature needs to work in order to be able to cool the entire surrounding and not just one area. (Explicit). <br> 2. The user had trouble contacting the maker about potential solutions to the problems they were having with the product. (Explicit). <br> 3. The device did not fully function once the user received the device from the vendor. (Explicit). |
| “I bought this fan a little over a year ago. I barely ever used it. The motor probably had 5 hours of running time. After about 7 months of not using it in a spare room, I turned it on and within one minute it completed quit. I assume it’s a fuse but either way I won’t buy another one bc replacing the fuse or motor requires soldering and replacing the part which is more time consuming and expensive than it is to buy something else. So for about $60 I got about 6 hours of use out it and it was in perfect condition. Maybe I received a lemon but I do not recommend.” | 1. The fans battery life did not seem to last very long even with minimal use. (Explicit). <br> 2. The repairs for the device are far more expensive and time consuming then the user would like or need to keep using it. (Explicit). <br>  3. The device was expensive compared to how much use the user was able to get from it. (Explicit). |
| “I regret buying this fan. With all the reviews and the high rating I thought the fan would be decent. For the first week it was ok, but then of course we get rid of the box and it starts making this horrible buzzing noise while it's on. And the fan noise doesn't drown it out, if you turn the fan speed higher it just gets worse. The fan really is also only any good if you're sitting in front of it, it doesn't cool down the room at all like our other tower fan. I do like the soft buttons on the remote though...but that isn't why I got the fan. I don't recommend anyone getting this unless it's to put in a garage or somewhere where it'll be noisy when you have it on.” | 1. The fan was not completely quiet and often made terrible noises unlike it says in its product description. (Explicit). <br> 2. The fan did not rotate and often only cooled a small area compared to other fans that are similar. (Explicit). <br> 3. The remote was easy to use for the user and provided an easy way to adjust the speed whilst also not being hard to use. (Explicit). |

| “So glad I found this device as I was physically monitoring a space and it was becoming a chore more than it needed to be. This device saves me time and stress. Works perfectly, easy to program and change settings. Great product. | 1. The device fulfills its need to monitor the humidity of the surrounding area. (Explicit). <br> 2. The device reduces stress of the user by assisting in humidity control and humidity measurement. (Explicit). <br> 3. The device is easy to use and programs which are beneficial to all users. (Explicit). |
| “Love it. Easy to setup and works as intended. Has two sockets, I have an exhaust fan on socket 2 and works perfectly. Will def buy again for my next builds.” | 1. The device is easy to set up and use for the customers. (Explicit). <br> 2. The ease of use allows the user to save time and stress due to it being easy to operate. (Latent). <br>  3. The two sockets allow for more versatility for the user and allows for different accessories to be added to the product. (Latent). |
| “I wanted to replace my old humidifier. I like how the new ones work, and I bought a well-reviewed one with WiFi. The humidifier worked great, and the software was easy to use. Then, I discovered that it only maintains the humidity in a 10% range, along with other disturbing "features." I exchanged it for one that doesn't measure the humidity at all 8-( <br> <br> The Inkbird did exactly what the digital humidifier should have done. It allows me to set the target humidity and range below (and above, it also works with dehumidifiers,) and it also allows alarms for high/low humidity and even calibration. Everything is tenths of a percent, and the sensor actually seems to be that accurate. Most of all, it works perfectly!” | 1. Allows the user to be able to set the target humidity and range of the surroundings. (Explicit). <br> 2. The controller also works with dehumidifiers which is useful in maintaining ideal conditions for whatever you're doing. (Explicit). <br> 3. The alerts the device gives is valuable for maintaining the ideal conditions the user is seeking. (Explicit). |

| “Literally, from the very first day, back to back ER code and beeping. It hasn't worked AT ALL. I moved the sensor to a less humid spot. Still throws ER code. I'm growing Oyster mushrooms. If this isn't capable of handling the high humidity needed than the seller needs to remove the word MUSHROOM from the title. Lets hope the second one works better. As it sits now i get to drive across town, and wait in line at the cramped and very busy UPS store, during flu season, to return this POS. I drive a diesel. That's $25 in fuel. Who's paying for that? Oh yeah. I am. If the new one works correctly I will add a star, but its not getting 5 stars!!!” | 1. The device did not work as intended and seemingly malfunctioned by constantly warning the user even though the conditions weren’t bad. (Explicit). <br> 2. The device did not seem very good in high humidity according to the user. (Latent). <br> 3. The device's malfunctions seemingly annoyed the user and stressed them out due to the fact it could not operate properly for the users required task. (Latent). |
|  “We started using this humidity controller in our snake’s tank in January 2022. After about five months of daily use, it started malfunctioning — continuing to power the connected humidifier even after it had detected shut-off humidity levels. The result was a tank full of fog at 90+% humidity (30% above target range). <br><br>We were able to reset the device, but it malfunctioned again after several days. This cycle repeated a couple times, which became an obvious health hazard for our snake. We had no idea when it would stop working properly, and that increased the chance she would develop a respiratory infection. So we reached out to Inkbird support, and eventually they sent us a replacement. <br><br> The replacement device worked properly for about the same length of time before malfunctioning in the same way. We reached out to Inkbird a second time, and they encouraged us to buy the product again, since the 1-year warranty had expired. <br><br>All of this is just to say that manufacturing quality here is spotty at best, and you shouldn’t expect any one controller to last more than about 6 months. It works pretty well when it’s working, but the product is junk at its core.”| 1. The controller did not have a very long lifespan before it began to malfunction. (Explicit). <br> 2. Even after resetting the device, it seemingly still malfunctioned and did not work as intended. (Explicit). <br>  3. The materials used may not be high in quality and thus it may be why the product malfunctions or doesn’t work properly. (Latent). |
| “While it functions as advertised, the high humidity alarm function negates any positive action that the controller may provide. There is no way to disable the alarm function, so if your alarm goes off while you are not at home, your neighbors will think that a smoke alarm is going off and call emergency services. <br><br> Not worth any price.” | 1. The humidity alarm is not completely reliable and seemingly may inconvenience the user. (Explicit). <br> 2. The price may be far more expensive than what the user gets for the price. (Latent). <br> 3. The device's humidity alarm is very loud and distracting. (Explicit). |

### Use Cases:
---
#### User Story #1: John

John is a 33 year old middle school science teacher located in Phoenix Arizona. His class is currently studying climate and weather patterns in the Sonoran Desert. Typically, they use an old fashioned thermometer and record various temperatures throughout the day. The only thing is these temperatures are only monitored during school hours as John lives 45 minutes from the local school. Creating a device that can record the outdoor temperatures while surviving the harsh desert heat would be an ideal solution to help John give more accurate data to his students and take their science class to the next level. Proposed ideas for the Uniform Climate Controller aims to help John and anyone else who is looking for accurate weather tracking and recording. 

<br>

#### User Story #2: William

William is a 6’7” 26-year-old professional sprinter located in Miami Florida. When he’s not out running, he is inside trying to escape the heat and humidity of Florida summers. His current air conditioning setup is lacking in some regards in terms of power, and usage. William wants a way to both cool down and prevent his home from getting humid when exposed to the elements. His current unit doesn’t accurately track the humidity in the environment or keep a log of the levels of humidity and temperature. He is excited about the new Uniform Climate Controller (UCC). With his new UCC, he can properly control the air in his house and schedule/forecast the future conditions of the house to ensure that it is in a proper climate at the proper time. William can control the climate in his house from anywhere and ensure that he has a comfortable house to come home to after his runs, safe from the Florida weather. 

Now William will only buy his climate control devices from UCC, for all of his comfort needs.
