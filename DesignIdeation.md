# Design Ideation

Now that we had viewed several different concepts and identified what we valued most, our team began generating ideas. We created a Google Jam Board to record all of our ideas and began brainstorming. During this process, no ideas were bad ideas as general topics such as batteries, sparked many additional ideas. Once we had these ideas, we then categorized and ranked them into what we identified as three different topics. These topics included appearance, power and functionality. The organized list of ideas can be seen below.

**Note:** See [Appendix C](/Appendix/AppendixMain.md#appendix-c) for full list of ideas.

*Figure 2: Ideation Organization - Funcitonality*

Functionality had the most notes. Above, the green notes are identified as most important, yellow is medium importance and pink is low importance. Once all these ideas were gathered, we began creating concept sketches that included our identified key elements. These sketches and descriptions are as follows.

This first Concept is a simple standing fan and climate monitoring system. It satisfies the need for two environmental sensors by utilizing temperature and humidity sensors to detect and display the detected climate in its environment. The fan cools the surrounding area according to a customizable setting, allowing the user to control the temperature in their environment. The fan speed can be controlled via the microcontroller or through the user.

This handheld device can be a standalone tool to catch a break from the surrounding heat by blowing cool air at the user. With comfortable grips and a powerful fan, along with two temperature sensors and a humidity sensor, one can monitor one's climate while staying cool enough to handle the extreme outside temperatures. The fan blades are set far enough away from the user's hand that prevents any injury to the user. The blades would also be made of a softer flexible material that adds an additional layer of protection.

*Image 3: Design 3*

This design consists of 2 environmental sensors, which detect the temperature and humidity in the surrounding environment. Utilizing the information gathered from these sensors, it uses its three fans to either cool the environment or increase or decrease the moisture in the area. The temperature and humidity will be displayed on the screen embedded in the device, and the user will be able to fully control the climate in their environment with the push of a button as the device works to change the environment to a standard set by the user.
