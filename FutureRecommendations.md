# Future Recommendations

**To future students of EGR 314:**

This is an intimidating course, but reaching the end is possible if you put in the effort. If we could do it so can you! Here are five tips that can help to ensure your success.

1. __Apply skills from EGR 304:__ Remember the ICC's and skills taught in 304, they are essential and will help better your understanding of the material covered in 314. Apply these principles to your final project and class assignments, and do not hesitate save and revisit assignments to refresh your memory.

2. __Teamwork:__ Much like 304, your success in 314 relies on your ability to work well with your team. Utilize each other's strengths and communicate openly to make sure everyone is on track. Listen to everyones input and remember no idea is a bad one.

3. __Clear Communication with professors:__ If you have any questions, do not hesitate to email your professor or stop by office hours. This will help address any concerns about your project and provide useful insight.

4. __Utilize teaching assistants and teammates:__ The TA's are there to help you succeed so do not be afraid to ask them quesitons about your project. Your teammates will be from different backgrounds and have different skill sets so don't shy away from working together to handle a difficult situation.

5. __Time Management:__ Time is a valuable resource, especially towards the end of the semester. Make sure you plan ahead and set aside time to go over the class materials and find time to meet with your group to discuss assignments and plan your project. It is never too early to start working ahead.
