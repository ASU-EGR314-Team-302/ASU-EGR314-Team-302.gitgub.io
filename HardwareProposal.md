# Hardware Proposal

The schematic design aligns with user needs by incorporating all the essential features required to meet user satisfaction per our user needs. It integrates a temperature sensor to measure the surrounding temperature and transmit the data to the microcontroller. Additionally, it includes a humidity sensor to monitor the humidity levels of the environment, also relaying this information to the microcontroller. 

The inclusion of a motor driver enhances the device's functionality beyond that of a mere thermometer, allowing for control of the fan. The fan serves to cool during elevated temperatures and features a manual switch for convenient on/off control. The microcontroller plays a pivotal role in orchestrating these components, enabling autonomous activation of the fan during elevated temperatures without user intervention. Furthermore, it facilitates data transmission to the GitHub website via Wi-Fi, courtesy of the ESP2 module connected to the microcontroller. 

In summary, the design comprehensively fulfills all user requirements by providing a device capable of temperature and humidity monitoring while effectively cooling the surroundingsâ€”an essential feature, particularly in hot regions like Arizona.
