# Lessons Learned


As a team, we learned numerous invaluable lessons throughout the course of EGR 314. Below, we've compiled our top 10 insights:

1. Verifying microcontroller restraints and requirements is crucial. Failure to do so can lead to unexpected setbacks and complications during the project.

2. Starting early and staying ahead is essential in a course like this. Procrastination can leave you vulnerable to unforeseen challenges, so it's wise to tackle assignments promptly to avoid falling behind.

3. Leaving additional room around components provides flexibility for troubleshooting and potential part replacements. Overcrowding components can lead to difficulties in diagnosing and addressing issues.

4. Adding extra header pins serves as both a troubleshooting aid and a backup connection point, mitigating risks of connectivity issues during the project.

5. Opting for larger parts whenever feasible can streamline the soldering process and offer higher power capabilities, potentially simplifying design and implementation tasks.

6. Using a diode to protect the voltage regulator from backfeed during snap programmer connections helps safeguard against potential damage and ensures the stability of the circuitry.

7. Prioritizing simplicity in microcontroller selection can significantly reduce complexities and headaches throughout the project's development stages.

8. Always having a backup plan ready proves invaluable, as initial plans often require adjustments or may fail to yield desired outcomes. Preparedness for contingencies can prevent project delays and setbacks.

9. Effective communication among team members is paramount for meeting deadlines and ensuring project success. Maintaining a positive attitude fosters a collaborative environment conducive to productive teamwork.

10. Embracing change and remaining adaptable is essential, as projects evolve over time. Being open to new ideas and iterations allows projects to grow and improve as unforeseen challenges arise and solutions are discovered throughout the course.
