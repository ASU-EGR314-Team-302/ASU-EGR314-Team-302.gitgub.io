# Selected Design

The design we have chosen incorporates a standing fan with an on off switch so that the user
can manually turn the fan off or on based on their preference. The device includes both a
temperature sensor and humidity sensor which will gather data from the environment
and send that data via wifi to the GitHub page. Based on the readings the fan will turn
on when the temperature reads as too hot. Included in the design is a stand so that it can be
placed in rooms to monitor the surroundings and stand on its own.

# Design Revisions

Due to complications that occurred during testing, the team was forced to take a slightly different approach on the physical design of the project. Instead of a standing fan, the team secured the fan in a port on the side of the enclosure that housed the circuit board. The final design also removed the support stand since it would not be needed with the fan mounted to the side of the enclosure. The main reason for these design changes was the lack of time required to construct the standing fan structure after we troubleshot the issuses we were facing with the PCB.
