# Selected Design

The design we have chosen incorporates a standing fan with an on off switch so that the user
can manually turn the fan off or on based on their preference. The device includes both a
temperature sensor and humidity sensor which will gather data from the environment
and send that data via wifi to the GitHub page. Based on the readings the fan will turn
on when the temperature reads as too hot. Included in the design is a stand so that it can be
placed in rooms to monitor the surroundings and stand on its own.
