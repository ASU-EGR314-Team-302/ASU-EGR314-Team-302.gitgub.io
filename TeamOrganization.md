# Team Organization

<!--## Introduction

 For this semester, our team was assigned with creating a mobile weather station that utilizes two different weather condition sensors to record and operate a motor via wifi connection. The allowed sensors are: 
* Temperature
* Humidity
* Atmospheric pressure
* Wind speed

The motor must additionally be controlled by a motor controller communicating over the I2C or SPI-based protocol. Once completed, the assigned projects will then be displayed at an innovation showcase where a working model is required. -->


## Team Charter

After reviewing the criteria listed in the introduction, our group came together and started by outlining a team goal. Our group's goal is to make a functional device that can measure both the external temperature of its surroundings and the humidity. It will then record the values via a wifi connection and regulate the measured temperature and humidity. Additionally, it will activate a fan that will have a veritable wind speed based on the recorded temperature and or humidity to make sure the surroundings are at a temperate condition. The personal goals that our team aims to achieve by working on this project include developing our professional skill set, gaining experience in a more professional environment, sharing our knowledge with others, developing a product that fulfills our expectations, creating something that we could develop further into a marketable product, and exploring our passions throughout the creation of this product.


## Mission Statement

Once our goals were established, we began focusing on creating a more refined mission statement that would encompass what matters to us most. Our team's mission statement is to design a reliable product that focuses on sustainability and longevity that is simple yet effective at monitoring and recording environmental changes in temperature and humidity. This mission statement focuses on reliability and sustainability. In addition, we also chose to use temperature and humidity during this stage as our two different weather condition sensors. 

The next step was to create a system of communication for the team outside of class as well as establishing a meeting schedule. These charts as well as our conflict resolution plans can be seen in [Appendix A](/Appendix/AppendixMain.md#appendix-a)
