## Establishing User Needs and Benchmarks

Now that the team has a goal and a work schedule created, the next step was to conduct research on similar products in order to identify the strengths and weaknesses. This is an essential part to product development as it gives you a great opportunity to learn what ideas have worked in the past as well as identifying what features didn’t work as well as intended. We took 5 similar products and to what we are hoping to achieve and recorded the pros and cons of each of each left by their consumers. Our products include: 

* Indoor/Outdoor thermometer
* Mini-hydrometer
* Digital hydrometer and thermometer
* Tower fan
* Humidity Controller

The full list of product information as well as the recorded feedback from the assignments can be found in [Appendix B](/ASU-EGR314-Team-302.gitgub.io//Appendix/AppendixBUserNeeds) We then copied all the user needs recorded onto a Google Jam board for easier management as well as adding a few other key notes that we discovered while viewing other products. This list can be seen below:

# Product Requirements:

We went about turning the User needs we had  into practical and functional requests that would be necessary to suit the users. Some of the ideas that we had for user needs didn’t change much because they were already things we could practically implement into our device such as having an efficient battery and or power system.  Other ideas were based on derivatives of other ideas in order to give us options and or variety when say selecting what battery we might use for a power source.



Our teams most important characteristics are: 
* The product should be able to read the surrounding temperature.
* The product should be able to withstand the elements.
* The product should be able to read the humidity of the surroundings.
* The product should have an efficient power source.
* The fan should be able to activate via user input.
* The fan should be able to cool the surrounding area and reduce humidity.
* The product should be able to be operated by one person or a single user.
