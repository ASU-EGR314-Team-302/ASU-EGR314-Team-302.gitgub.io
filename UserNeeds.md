## Establishing User Needs and Benchmarks

Now that the team has a goal and a work schedule created, the next step was to conduct research on similar products in order to identify the strengths and weaknesses. This is an essential part to product development as it gives you a great opportunity to learn what ideas have worked in the past as well as identifying what features didnâ€™t work as well as intended. We took 5 similar products and to what we are hoping to achieve and recorded the pros and cons of each of each left by their consumers. Our products include: 

* Indoor/Outdoor thermometer
* Mini-hydrometer
* Digital hydrometer and thermometer
* Tower fan
* Humidity Controller

The full list of product information as well as the recorded feedback from the assignments can be found in [Appendix B: User Needs.](/ASU-EGR314-Team-302.gitgub.io//Appendix/AppendixATeamOrganization.md) We then copied all the user needs recorded onto a Google Jam board for easier management as well as adding a few other key notes that we discovered while viewing other products. This list can be seen below:
