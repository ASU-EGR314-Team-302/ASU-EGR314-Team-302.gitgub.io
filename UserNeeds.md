## Establishing User Needs and Benchmarks

Now that the team has a goal and a work schedule created, the next step is to research similar products to identify their strengths and weaknesses. This is an essential part of product development as it gives you a great opportunity to learn what ideas have worked in the past as well as identify what features didn’t work as well as intended. We took 5 similar products and what we are hoping to achieve and record the pros and cons of each left by their consumers. Our products include: 

* Indoor/Outdoor thermometer
* Mini-hygrometer
* Digital hygrometer and thermometer
* Tower fan
* Humidity Controller

The full list of product information, as well as the recorded feedback from the assignments, can be found in [Appendix B](/Appendix/AppendixMain.md#appendix-b) 

We then copied all the user needs recorded onto a Google Jam board for easier management as well as adding a few other keynotes that we discovered while viewing other products. This list can be seen below:

## Product Requirements:

We went about turning the User needs we had  into practical and functional requests that would be necessary to suit the users. Some of the ideas that we had for user needs didn’t change much because they were already things we could realistically implement into our device such as having an efficient battery and or power system.  Other ideas were based on derivatives of other ideas to give us options and or variety when, for example, selecting what battery we might use for a power source.



Our team's most important characteristics are: 
* The product should be able to read the surrounding temperature.
* The product should be able to withstand the elements.
* The product should be able to read the humidity of the surroundings.
* The product should have an efficient power source.
* The fan should be able to activate via user input.
* The fan should be able to cool the surrounding area and reduce humidity.
* The product should be able to be operated by one person or a single user.

**Note: Use cases, aspects, and compiled needs used to derive important characteristics can be found in [Appendix D](/Appendix/AppendixMain.md#appendix-d)**

After moving through the component selection, software, and hardware Implementations, our team has concluded that all of these design aspects are attainable for our project. The [Selected Design](SelectedDesign.md) page, will go more in depth on our final design choice and the resonings behind it.
