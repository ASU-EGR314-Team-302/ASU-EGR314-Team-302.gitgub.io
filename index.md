# Introduction

<!-- This semester, our team was assigned with creating a mobile weather station that utilizes two different weather condition sensors to record and operate a motor via wifi connection. The allowed sensors are:

* Temperature
* Humidity
* Atmospheric Pressure
* Wind Speed

The motor must additionally be controlled by a motor controller communicating over the I2C or SPI-based protocol. Once completed, the assigned projects will then be displayed at an innovation showcase where a working model is required. -->

This semester, our team embarked on an exciting project tasked with the creation of a portable climate control station designed to provide real-time weather/environmental data and manipulate the surrounding environment. The objective is to incorporate two distinct weather condition sensors capable of accurately measuring a range of environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and wind speed. Through a wifi connection, these sensors will transmit data to a central processing unit which will then execute commands to operate a motor. This motor, crucial to the functionality of the Uniform Climate Control device, will be controlled by a motor controller utilizing information produced by the sensors (I2C or SPI-based protocol for communication) to then control the climate in the vicinity. As the culmination of our efforts, the completed project will be displayed at ASU's innovation showcase.
